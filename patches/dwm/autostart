Cool autostart
Description

Allow dwm to execute commands from autostart array in your config.h file. And when you exit dwm all processes from autostart array will be killed.
Example

static const char *const autostart[] = {
	"mpd-notification", NULL,
	"hsetroot", "-center", "/usr/home/bit6tream/pic/wallapper.png", NULL,
	"xrdb", "/usr/home/bit6tream/.config/X/Xresources", NULL,
	"sh", "-c", "while :; do dwmstatus.sh -; sleep 60; done", NULL,
	"dunst", NULL,
	"picom", NULL,
	NULL
};

Attention

Commands from array are executed using execvp(). So if you need to execute shell command you need to prefix it with "sh", "-c" (change sh to any shell you like).
