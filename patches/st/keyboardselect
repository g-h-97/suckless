Notes

When you run "keyboard_select", you have 3 modes available :

    move mode : to set the start of the selection;
    select mode : to activate and set the end of the selection;
    input mode : to enter the search criteria.

Shortcuts for move and select modes :

 h, j, k, l:    move cursor left/down/up/right (also with arrow keys)
 !, _, *:       move cursor to the middle of the line/column/screen
 Backspace, $:  move cursor to the beginning/end of the line
 PgUp, PgDown : move cursor to the beginning/end of the column
 Home, End:     move cursor to the top/bottom left corner of the screen
 /, ?:          activate input mode and search up/down
 n, N:          repeat last search, up/down
 s:             toggle move/selection mode
 t:             toggle regular/rectangular selection type
 Return:        quit keyboard_select, keeping the highlight of the selection
