swap focus
Description

This patch makes it possible to switch focus with one single shortcut (alt-s) instead of having to think if you should use alt-j or alt-k for reaching the last used window.
Changes in 6.2

    Remember the previous tag and previous clients on each tag.
    If there is no previous client on the current tag (because it was moved or killed), the next client on the current tag is focused.
